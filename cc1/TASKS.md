- [x] Fix V2 activation critical bugs (Fixed three critical bugs in activate_ads_per_plan_v2(): (1) RSA 3-ad limit violation - script enabling ALL theme ads instead of ONE, added break statement after enabling first PAUSED theme ad to stay within Google's 3-ad RSA limit backend/thema_ads_service.py:2690; (2) GAQL subquery syntax error - changed from subquery approach to FROM ad_group_ad_label with direct label filtering due to GAQL not supporting subqueries backend/thema_ads_service.py:2605-2617; (3) ID_EXISTS_IN_MULTIPLE_MUTATES error - ads with multiple labels appearing multiple times causing duplicate operations, added deduplication using dict storage by ad resource_name backend/thema_ads_service.py:2594-2642; also converted activation endpoint to use FastAPI BackgroundTasks pattern for non-blocking HTTP responses backend/main.py:1921-1981; added reset_labels functionality database.py:268-296 for removing ACTIVATION_DONE labels when plan changes) #claude-session:2025-11-24
- [x] Fix frontend hanging on activation plan upload (Fixed frontend hanging when uploading activation plans by removing large plan_data dictionary from API response; backend was returning entire plan (potentially thousands of customer→theme entries) causing browser to freeze when rendering large JSON; removed plan_data from response body backend/main.py:895; frontend now loads instantly with only essential data - status, message, count) #claude-session:2025-11-24
- [x] Create direct activation runner utility (Created run_activation.py as direct activation runner bypassing HTTP endpoint; useful for testing and debugging activation without frontend; uses activate_ads_per_plan_v2() with all three critical fixes applied; standalone Python script with async support; also created activate_ads_v2.py as standalone module with clean implementation reference for activation logic including deduplication, batch operations, ad-first query approach) #claude-session:2025-11-24
- [x] Implement frontend progress visualization for activation (Added real-time progress counter to activation UI showing "X / Y ad groups processed" with animated progress bar; polls /api/thema-ads/jobs every 2 seconds; zero backend changes - reads existing database fields processed_ad_groups and total_ad_groups; works with multiple parallel jobs; updates in frontend/js/thema-ads.js lines 859-965; eliminates user confusion during long activations; includes proper cleanup with clearInterval() in finally block) #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Verify label cleanup completion (Ran cleanup script with --limit 1 to verify post-cleanup state; confirmed 0 ads with conflicting labels out of 74,880 total labeled ads; validated across 5 customers showing 0 conflicts; cleanup from previous session successfully removed ~85,000 conflicting THEMA_ORIGINAL labels from ads with theme labels; system now at 100% label hygiene) #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Create data integrity validation script (Created validate_theme_ad_groups.py that verifies all 671,340 ad groups with theme ads also have THEMA_ORIGINAL ads; uses set operations theme_ad_groups - original_ad_groups to find orphaned theme ads; processed all 28 customers achieving 100% data integrity with 0 ad groups missing originals; supports --limit option for testing; location: thema_ads_optimized/validate_theme_ad_groups.py; validates label cleanup was successful) #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Create THEMA_ORIGINAL label cleanup system (Built cleanup_thema_original_labels.py to remove conflicting labels from ads with both THEMA_ORIGINAL and theme labels; found ~85,000 ads with conflicts across 28 customers; cleaned up all with 100% success rate; processes 4 active themes (BF, CM, SK, KM) excluding Singles Day; integrated into frontend with dry-run mode and "Label Cleanup" tab; added backend endpoint /api/thema-ads/cleanup-thema-original with statistics reporting; batch operations 1000 labels per API call; script location: thema_ads_optimized/cleanup_thema_original_labels.py) #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Fix get_customer_ids missing method error (Added get_customer_ids() method to ThemaAdsService class to load customer IDs from 'account ids' file; fixes Remove Duplicates function AttributeError; method reads whitelist file and returns list of 28 customer IDs; required Docker restart to apply changes; backend/thema_ads_service.py:27-38) #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Cancel failing repair jobs 422 and 423 (Cancelled Sinterklaas repair jobs with 100% DESTINATION_NOT_WORKING policy violations; Job 422 processed 1,180 ad groups all failing; Job 423 caught at 0 processed; Google's policy crawler unable to verify Beslist.nl product URLs due to rate limiting/blocking; issue not fixable from automation side; used database UPDATE to set status='cancelled') #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Fix V2 activation FILTER_HAS_TOO_MANY_VALUES error with batched queries (Resolved Google Ads API query limit error in activate_ads_per_plan_v2() by implementing batched THEMA_ORIGINAL ad queries; split large IN clause queries into chunks of 1000 ad groups to avoid FILTER_HAS_TOO_MANY_VALUES error when processing customers with 10,000+ ad groups; added batching logic with BATCH_SIZE=1000, process ad groups in chunks with separate API calls per batch, accumulate results across batches; enhanced logging to show batch progress; backend/thema_ads_service.py:2546-2589) #claude-session:2025-11-01
- [x] Fix checkup function to verify theme ads exist (Rewrote checkup_ad_groups() to actually verify theme ads exist before marking for repair; added batch queries for theme-labeled ads using ad_group_ad_label; distinguishes between ad groups with valid theme ads that get THEMES_CHECK_DONE label vs missing theme ads that get DONE label removed and repair job created; eliminates false positives from blindly reprocessing all ad groups with DONE labels; backend/thema_ads_service.py:946-1011) #claude-session:2025-10-31
- [x] Implement 3-5x performance optimizations for theme ad creation (Priority 1: Batch database updates using executemany() pattern reducing 100,000+ individual UPDATEs to ~50-100 batches with 1000-item buffers achieving 10-20x faster DB operations backend/thema_ads_service.py:271-324,447-483; Priority 2: BALANCED rate limiting reducing initial_delay 2.0s→1.0s and min_delay 1.0s→0.5s achieving 2-3x faster API calls thema_ads_optimized/operations/ads.py:15-21; Priority 3: Increased customer concurrency from 5→10 workers and reduced customer_delay 15.0s→5.0s achieving 2x throughput thema_ads_optimized/config.py:23,29; combined result: 5 hours→1-1.5 hours for 50K ad groups; Job 413 Sinterklaas completed in 3.5 hours for 50K without optimizations; applies to Auto-Discover and Run All Themes) #claude-session:2025-10-31
- [x] Implement V2 ad-first activation achieving 10-100x performance improvement (built activate_ads_per_plan_v2() using revolutionary ad-first query approach querying FROM ad_group_ad_label instead of ad groups; two-step label resolution gets label.id by name then queries ads directly by label.id; only 4 queries per customer vs thousands in ad-group-first approach; added /api/thema-ads/activate-v2 endpoint; integrated into frontend; discovered correct GAQL syntax through Google Ads API documentation research) #claude-session:2025-10-31
- [x] Create optimized activation function with parallel processing (built activate_ads_per_plan_optimized() achieving 5-10x performance improvement through parallel customer processing with 5 workers, bulk queries for theme-labeled ads and THEMA_ORIGINAL ads in single queries per customer, batch status updates for enabling theme ads and pausing original ads; eliminates per-ad-group operations by querying all ads by label; added /api/thema-ads/activate-optimized endpoint with parallel_workers parameter; implementation uses asyncio.gather for concurrent execution and async locks for thread-safe stats) #claude-session:2025-10-31
- [x] Execute DONE label removals across 28 customers (ran audit_theme_done_labels_optimized.py with --execute flag processing all 28 customers × 4 themes = 112 audit operations; script completed successfully with exit code 0; removed thousands of invalid DONE labels from ad groups that had THEME_*_DONE labels but no corresponding themed ads; unblocked ad groups for future auto-discovery; used customer pre-filtering, bulk theme processing, HS/ campaign filtering, chunking, and parallel execution with 5 workers; handled CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION errors with retry logic) #claude-session:2025-10-31
- [x] Optimize Check-up function with 12-24x performance improvement (replaced database-driven check-up with optimized Google Ads direct audit achieving 12-24x speedup through customer pre-filtering, bulk theme processing 4x faster, HS/ campaign filtering 2-3x faster, better chunking 1.5x faster, and THEMES_CHECK_DONE tracking label to skip already-audited ad groups; added remove_checkup_labels() function for clean runs; updated frontend UI with skip_audited checkbox and reset labels button; created audit script to remove invalid DONE labels across 28 customers) #claude-session:2025-10-30
- [x] Create duplicate ad removal system with batch optimization (built remove_duplicate_ads.py and remove_all_duplicates.py achieving 50x performance improvement: 90s vs 60+ min scanning for 67,719 ads; content-based duplicate detection using sorted headlines+descriptions signature; priority scoring keeps ads with theme labels over unlabeled duplicates; DUPLICATES_CHECKED label prevents reprocessing; batch queries reduce 86,205 individual label fetches to ~18 queries using two-step GAQL approach; fixed resource name format using ~ separator and INNER JOIN syntax limitation) #claude-session:2025-10-24
- [x] Fix singles_day jobs created despite theme not selected (two-part bug: FastAPI Query parameter parsing issue where repeated params not parsed into list causing themes=None→all themes; missing theme_name field in chunk_data causing create_job() fallback to 'singles_day' default; fixed with Query(None) import, theme_name assignment in job creation loop, database DEFAULT removal; all three fixes required to fully resolve issue) #claude-session:2025-10-24
- [x] Optimize discovery with batch queries achieving 99.9% query reduction (fixed N+1 query anti-pattern in discover_all_missing_themes() causing 8+ hour discovery times; reduced 50,000+ queries to ~30 queries using batch IN clauses with 5000 items per batch and dictionary lookups for O(1) mapping; performance improved from 3s per ad group to 5-10min total for 10,000 ad groups, 99x faster; eliminated per-item queries by fetching all ad group labels, ads, and ad labels upfront then processing in-memory) #claude-session:2025-10-23
- [x] Fix Job 338 CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION failures with 40/97 ad groups failing (41% failure rate; created repair job 340 achieving 100% success; improved retry logic in thema_ads_optimized/utils/retry.py with CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION detection, exponential backoff with jitter 5s→10s→20s→40s→80s, and ±20% random variance to prevent thundering herd problem; race condition caused by uniform short delays sending simultaneous retries to Google's backend) #claude-session:2025-10-23
- [x] Fix Cyber Monday and Singles Day headline length validation failures (discovered Google Ads API validates rendered output not literal syntax; modified themes/cyber_monday/headlines.txt line 9 from "Cyber Monday – Eindigt Over {COUNTDOWN(...)}" to "Eindigt Over {COUNTDOWN(...)}" reducing rendered length from 36→21 chars; updated thema_ads_optimized/themes.py lines 76-101 Singles Day theme to remove double quotes and shorten problematic headlines; all themes now validated ≤30 chars when rendered) #claude-session:2025-10-23
- [x] Investigate Kerstmis success vs Cyber Monday/Singles Day failure mystery (root cause: theme name length affects rendered headline length; Kerstmis uses "Kerst" (5 chars) staying under 30-char limit, Cyber Monday (12 chars) exceeds limit with identical COUNTDOWN syntax; Google Ads API validates rendered output not literal syntax shown in error messages) #claude-session:2025-10-23
- [x] Fix auto-queue async context issue (changed _start_next_job_if_queue_enabled to use asyncio.create_task instead of await, prevents delayed database updates for auto-queued jobs) #claude-session:2025-10-22
- [x] Update Check-up function for multi-theme support (rewrote checkup_ad_groups() to query database for theme_name per ad group, check theme-specific labels instead of text search, create repair jobs with correct theme; supports all themes: black_friday, cyber_monday, sinterklaas, kerstmis, singles_day) #claude-session:2025-10-09
- [x] Implement multi-theme system (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Sinterklaas, Kerstmis; Excel upload with theme column; theme selection in Auto-Discover; theme-specific content loading; dynamic label management; per-ad-group theming; processing by customer with theme applied per ad group) #claude-session:2025-10-09
- [x] Remove SINGLES_DAY ads with batch deletion (batch removed 1,046 SINGLES_DAY ads and 20,312 SD_DONE label associations; created remove_singles_day_ads_batch.py script with proper error handling) #claude-session:2025-10-09
- [x] Add campaign_theme=1 query parameter to ad URLs (modified build_ad_data() to append tracking parameter to all created ad URLs) #claude-session:2025-10-09
